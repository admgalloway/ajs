To create a clean instance of the the db, run the following command targetted at your sql server instance:

C:\dev\MAD\packages\FluentMigrator.1.2.1.0\tools\Migrate.exe


migrate -c "server=UK1SQL01;Database=ADS;Integrated Security=SSPI" -db "sqlserver2008" -a "C:\dev\WeeWorld.ADS\WeeWorld.ADS.Migrations\bin\Debug\WeeWorld.ADS.Migrations.dll" -t "migrate:up"
migrate -c "server=t0nkx2lgm9.database.windows.net;Database=ajs;User ID=ajs@t0nkx2lgm9;Password=Glasgow101" -db "sqlserver2008" -a "C:\dev\WeeWolrd.ADS\WeeWorld.ADS.Migrations\bin\Debug\WeeWorld.ADS.Migrations.dll" -t "migrate:up"

-c: the connection string targeting your instance of sql server.
-db: the type of database server your running migrations against.
-a: the full filepath to the WeeWorld.ADS.Migrations dll generated when you build the project.
-t: the migration task to carry out. defaults to migrating up to the latest version.

notes:

The migrator tool is installed in the nuget packages directory when you build the application.
To run migrations, execute the command from that directory or specificy the full pathname in the command. 

Alternatively, add the directory to your path environment variable.


You'll need to set the connection string (-c) param accordingly to point to your server and login credentials.
